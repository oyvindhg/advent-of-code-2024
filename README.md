# :page_with_curl::detective: Advent of Code 2024 :teacher::sled:

Go solutions to the [2024 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) problems.

## Running :gift:

Download the puzzle input and store it in `challenges/day{DD}/input/input.txt` where `{DD}` is the day number. 

The solutions can be run as follows:

```
go run ./challenges/day{DD}
``` 

For example, `go run ./challenges/day01` runs the solution for the first day.

## Testing :christmas_tree:

Run the solutions on test data:

```
go test ./challenges/day{DD} -v
```
The `-v` flag can be omitted for less verbose output.
